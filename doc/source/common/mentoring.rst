The Cohorts
===========

As it stands right now, there are 4 mentoring cohorts:

* Get your first patch merged: Mentors will assist mentees with crafting
  a change, understanding and adhering to the Developers Guide, submitting
  to Gerrit, responding to reviews, and ultimately having their change
  accepted.
* First CFP submission or Give your first talk: Mentors will assist mentees
  with submitting a CFP and  preparing to give a talk. This could be
  for OpenStack Summit, OpenStack Days, a local meetup, or another conference
  or event.
* Deploy your first Cloud: Mentors will provide assistance to mentees
  deploying OpenStack for the first time. This could involve analysis of
  available deployment tools, configuration, or troubleshooting.
* Become COA certified or study for COA: Mentors will provide support and
  guidance to mentees as they prepare for the COA exam.

If there is a topic you are interested in mentoring someone in, or being
mentored in, the organizers are always looking for new ideas! Please fill
out the form below that corresponds to your roll and let them know!

Participating as a Mentor
=========================

The first thing you'll want to do is sign up using this `mentor form
<https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoring_cohorts_mentors>`_.
This will get you into our spreadsheet of mentors so that we can keep track
of who is working with which group so when we need to help bolster certain
cohorts with calls for mentors, we can see who is already involved.

Participating as a Mentee
=========================

Similar to being a mentor, the first thing you'll want to do is sign
up using this `mentee form <https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoring_cohorts_menteess>`_.
This will help us know who is participating and what their goals are.

Join the Mailing List & IRC Channel
===================================

.. note::

  This section assumes you have completed the :doc: '/common/irc' section
  of the contributor guide. It might also be helpful to cover the more
  generic information about mailing lists in the Communication
  page's :ref:`communication-mailing-lists` section as well.

Mentoring Mailing List
----------------------

The mailing list is where most day to day asynchronous interactions happen.
Here is where you can get  `subscribed and view ML archives <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-mentoring>`_.

When sending emails to the ML, if your subject is specific to one cohort,
please use the relevant tag:

* [first-patch] for getting your first patch merged
* [first-cfp] for giving your first conference talk
* [first-cloud] for deploying your first cloud
* [coa] for becoming a Certified OpenStack Administrator

**Both mentors and mentees should subscribe to stay up to date with
conversations.**

#openstack-mentoring
--------------------

On IRC, we also have a dedicated channel for the topics our cohorts focus on.
Please join #openstack-mentoring whenever you are online to stay in the loop
and meet other people that have overlapping timezones- both mentors and
mentees.

General Information
-------------------

The cohort program is hosted under the `Diversity and Inclusion Working Group <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Diversity>`_. For more information about the cohort program, you can check out their `wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mentoring#Long_Term_Mentoring>`_.
