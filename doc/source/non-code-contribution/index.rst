Non-Code Contributor Guide
##########################

As with all Open Source communities, there are more ways to contribute than to
push code. If you're interested in doing that, great! You'll want to start over
here with the :doc:`../code-and-documentation/introduction` guide instead. If
not, you've come to the right place!

First, we would like to say welcome to our community! We may look big and
confusing at the start, but we promise that we are here to help you find your
place and answer your questions.

Depending on what you're interested in and the level of involvement you would
like to have, we have something for you! In the following sections of this
guide, we will cover all the different ways of contributing that don't deal
with writing code.

Getting to Know the Community
=============================

These sections of the guide will help you get to know our community's
structure - how we organize ourselves, how we organize the work we do
along a timeline, and what events we have to help us get things done.


* :doc:`../common/events` are essential to our community health and
  development process. While we as contributors span the globe, we
  occasionally get together to make progress face to face.

* :doc:`../common/governance` is not always the most thrilling
  topic, but its important to understand how we organize ourselves to
  help get the work done efficiently.

* :doc:`../common/releases` and understanding the process that
  the different OpenStack components go through gives context to how
  we work as a community.

Communicating with the Community
================================

These sections of the guide help you set up the tools you might need
to communicate with different parts of the community.

*  :doc:`../common/irc` (Internet Relay Chat) is our synchronous way of
   communicating.

* :doc:`../common/accounts` are important for a variety of
  activies such as participating in elections, filing bugs in our
  community task trackers, and submitting speaker presentations.

* :doc:`../common/communication` is the most important thing
  we can teach you in this guide. Without our mailing lists, IRC, and
  other community tools, we would not be able to collaborate across
  the globe to build the amazing software that we do.

Non-Code Contribution Types
===========================

* :doc:`../common/mentoring` in the OpenStack community is set up
  to be a light weight cohort style program where each cohort focuses
  on accomplishing a specific goal.
